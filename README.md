# Nix Config

Personal multi-host Nix flake for Linux and macOS. It uses Nix for system-level state and package installation, while keeping dotfiles linkable as a separate user-level layer instead of tightly coupling them to Home Manager.

## What This Repo Defines

- NixOS hosts: `dev-4`, `nixos`, `vlinix`
- Darwin host: `macix`
- Shared system layer in `hosts/common`
- Shared Home Manager layer in `home`
- Shared helper library in `lib`
- Shared and platform-specific dotfiles in `dotfiles`
- Multiagent workflow docs and runtime configs under `docs/workflow` and hidden files in `dotfiles/common`

The flake entrypoint is [flake.nix](./flake.nix). Host definitions are wired into `nixosConfigurations` and `darwinConfigurations`, with common `specialArgs` such as `hostName`, `username`, `system`, `pkgs-unstable`, and `mylib`.

## Main Stack

This config is built around:

- `nixpkgs` and `nixpkgs-unstable` for packages
- `nix-darwin` for macOS system management
- Home Manager mainly for user-level package installation
- `disko` for Linux disk layout
- `agenix` plus a private `secrets` flake for secret material
- Homebrew on macOS for native apps that are better managed outside Nix

The helper library in [lib/default.nix](./lib/default.nix) provides:

- `scanPaths` to auto-import module directories
- `scanFiles` to walk dotfile trees
- `linkDotfiles` plus platform predicates for Linux/Darwin splits

## Main Tasks This Config Covers

- Bootstrap a new workstation
- Manage Linux and macOS machines from one flake
- Install a development environment with shells, editors, formatters, linters, and language servers
- Configure a Linux desktop around Hyprland and Wayland tools
- Configure a macOS machine with `nix-darwin` defaults and Homebrew apps
- Install packages and root-related system configuration
- Link shared dotfiles into `$HOME` independently
- Provide AI and agent tooling such as `opencode`, `qwen-code`, and workflow runtime files

## Tooling Included

The shared Home Manager package bundles are under [home/pkgs](./home/pkgs).

Highlights:

- Shell and CLI: `atuin`, `zoxide`, `starship`, `tmux`, `fzf`, `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fd`, `eza`
- Editors and terminals: `neovim`, `kitty`, `ghostty`, `zed-editor`
- AI tools: `opencode`, `qwen-code`, `github-copilot-cli`, `promptfoo`
- Dev tooling: `clang`, `nil`, `nixd`, `nixfmt`, `ruff`, `basedpyright`, `bash-language-server`, `vtsls`, `eslint`, `prettierd`, `cmake`, `gnumake`
- Network and ops: `git`, `gh`, `mtr`, `iperf3`, `socat`, `nmap`, `openssl`
- Linux desktop: `hyprland`, `waybar`, `dunst`, `rofi`, `hyprlock`, `hypridle`, `hyprpaper`, `localsend`, `throne`
- macOS native apps through Homebrew: `aerospace`, `docker-desktop`, `ghostty`, `zed`, `codex`, `zen@twilight`

## Repo Structure

- [hosts](./hosts): host entrypoints and shared system modules
- [home](./home): Home Manager entrypoint, package bundles, and dotfile activation
- [lib](./lib): helper functions used across the flake
- [dotfiles](./dotfiles): source files linked into the user home directory
- [docs/workflow](./docs/workflow): multiagent workflow specification and adapter docs

Composition flow:

1. `flake.nix` selects a host.
1. The host imports `hosts/common/default.nix`.
1. `hosts/common/default.nix` imports shared system modules and `home/default.nix`.
1. `home/default.nix` imports all package bundles, the Omarchy activation layer, and the `link-dotfiles` helper definition.
1. Dotfiles are linked from `dotfiles/common` and the active platform directory when activation runs or when `link-dotfiles` is called manually.

## Using This In Your Own Environment

This repo is personal, so using it unchanged on another machine will usually fail unless you adapt it. The main blockers are the private `secrets` input, host-specific hardware modules, usernames, disk layout, and some machine-specific assumptions.

Recommended path:

1. Fork or copy the repository.
1. Update the host map in [flake.nix](./flake.nix) with your own host name, username, and target system.
1. Remove or replace the private `secrets` input if you do not have access to `git@github.com/khrore/nixrets.git`.
1. Replace Linux hardware files and `disko` definitions under your host directory.
1. Review shared modules in [hosts/common](./hosts/common) and disable anything you do not want globally, especially Hyprland, Docker, `localsend`, `throne`, SSH, and age secret paths.
1. Trim or replace package bundles in [home/pkgs](./home/pkgs) to match your workload.
1. Add or replace files in [dotfiles](./dotfiles) with your own configs.

## Bootstrap Commands

### NixOS

After cloning the repo to `$HOME/nixos` or setting `NIXOS_CONFIG_ROOT`:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#your-host
```

For first install on bare metal, you will also need your own hardware config and, if you keep it, a matching `disko` layout.

### macOS

Install Nix and `nix-darwin`, then apply:

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#your-host
```

The Darwin host in this repo also enables Homebrew integration, so the initial activation expects Homebrew-compatible settings and a valid primary user.

## Dotfiles Behavior

[home/link-dotfiles.nix](./home/link-dotfiles.nix) installs a `link-dotfiles` command and also hooks it into Home Manager activation. The dotfiles are not tightly coupled to Home Manager after that point: you can run `link-dotfiles` manually at any time to relink configs without reapplying the full Nix configuration.

At runtime the script searches for the repo in:

- `$NIXOS_CONFIG_ROOT`
- `$HOME/nixos`
- `$HOME/.config/nixos`
- or a nearby checkout under `$HOME`

Platform-specific files override `dotfiles/common` by relative path. Existing non-symlink files in `$HOME` are left in place and reported as warnings.

Manual usage:

```bash
link-dotfiles
```

## Validation

Smallest relevant checks after changes:

```bash
nix flake check
nixos-rebuild build --flake .#dev-4
nixos-rebuild build --flake .#nixos
darwin-rebuild build --flake .#macix
```

Some evaluation paths may still require access to the private `secrets` flake.

## Multiagent Workflow Files

This repo also contains a portable multiagent workflow spec. The main docs are:

- [docs/workflow/core-spec.md](./docs/workflow/core-spec.md)
- [docs/workflow/handoff-schema.md](./docs/workflow/handoff-schema.md)
- [docs/workflow/policy.md](./docs/workflow/policy.md)
- [docs/workflow/adapter-mapping.md](./docs/workflow/adapter-mapping.md)
- [docs/workflow/implementation-plan.md](./docs/workflow/implementation-plan.md)

Runtime-specific configs live under hidden files in `dotfiles/common`, including OpenCode and Codex agent configuration.
